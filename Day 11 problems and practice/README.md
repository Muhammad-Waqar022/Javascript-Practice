âœ… Day 11 â€“ Asynchronous JavaScript
ðŸ”¸ Topics Covered:
setTimeout() and setInterval()

clearInterval()

Callback Functions

Promises (then, catch, finally)

async/await

Error Handling in Async Code

ðŸ”¹ Practice Problems Solved:
Delay a Message using setTimeout

Repeated Logger using setInterval and clearInterval

Simple Callback Function Example

Promise-Based Condition: Check if a number is even

Chained Promises: Show first step then second

async/await with setTimeout to simulate loading

Promise with Error Handling using .catch()

Handling API calls using async/await (optional extension)

ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
JS is non-blocking; async code helps manage time-based or API tasks.

Promises help structure async logic in a cleaner way than callbacks.

async/await makes code easier to read and write.

Use try...catch blocks to handle errors in async code.
