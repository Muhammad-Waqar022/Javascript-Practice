# üìò JavaScript Practice ‚Äì Day 4

This folder contains all the **practice problems** and a **mini project** I completed on **Day 4** of my JavaScript learning journey.

The focus for today was mastering **JavaScript objects** and related concepts.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

- **Objects ‚Äì Core Concepts**
- **Object Creation & Access**
- **Object Properties & Methods**
- **Object Display** using `console.log()` and `JSON.stringify()`

## üõ†Ô∏è Mini Project: Simple User Profile System

As part of today's practice, I built a mini project called **_Simple User Profile System_**.

This project demonstrates:
- Creating user profiles using object constructors
- Adding custom methods to each user object (like greetings)
- Merging user data with additional info using the spread operator
- Extracting object values cleanly using destructuring
- Displaying full profile data using `JSON.stringify()` for formatted output

This hands-on project helped solidify my understanding of how JavaScript objects work in real applications.
