# 🚀 DOM Manipulation & Events – Practice Projects

This repository contains my JavaScript practice work for **DOM Manipulation & Events**. It includes a series of problem files and three complete mini-projects to strengthen my DOM skills using pure JavaScript.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Selecting DOM elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.)
- Modifying element content (`textContent`, `innerHTML`)
- Styling elements with `.style`
- Creating and removing elements dynamically
- Event handling using `addEventListener`
- Using event objects, `preventDefault()`, and `stopPropagation()`

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

These problems demonstrate fundamental DOM manipulation concepts:

1. **Change Text on Button Click**
2. **Change Text Color on Button Click**
3. **Add a New Paragraph to a Container**
4. **Remove an Element from the Page**
5. **Block a Link with `preventDefault()`**
6. **Stop Event Bubbling with `stopPropagation()`**

All problem files are included in the root folder.

### 2. 📌 [`faq-accordion/`](./faq-accordion)
An interactive FAQ accordion where:
- Clicking a question toggles its answer
- Only one answer is shown at a time

### 3. 📌 [`max-char-limit-checker/`](./max-char-limit-checker)
