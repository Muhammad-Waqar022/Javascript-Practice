📅 Day 7 – Loops & Iteration 
As part of my JavaScript learning journey, I completed Day 7, which focuses on loops, iteration methods, loop control statements, and working with array-like structures. I also built a Student Attendance Tracker mini-project using all the concepts practiced.

✅ Topics I Covered Today
🔁 for, while, do...while loops

🔄 for...of vs for...in loops

🛑 Loop Control Statements: break & continue

📦 Iterables and Array-like Objects

These topics gave me a strong understanding of how to repeatedly perform tasks, control flow inside loops, and iterate over both arrays and objects.

🧠 Problems I Solved
To master these concepts, I practiced the following problems:

Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

Print all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop.

Count backward from 10 to 1 using a do...while loop.

Iterate over an array of fruits using for...of.

Iterate over a student object using for...in.

Use break to stop a loop when a condition is met.

Use continue to skip a specific iteration.

Iterate over the characters of a string using for...of.

These problems helped me apply each concept in real use-cases.

🧑‍🎓 Mini Project: Student Attendance Tracker
📌 Overview
I built a console-based Attendance Tracker where users can:

Enter the number of students.

Input student names one by one.

Skip empty entries (continue).

Exit early by typing "exit" or "Exit" (break).

Display a welcome message for each entered student.

🔧 Concepts Used
This project applies:

for loop for iteration

continue to skip invalid input

break to exit the loop early

for...of to greet students

Arrays to store input names
