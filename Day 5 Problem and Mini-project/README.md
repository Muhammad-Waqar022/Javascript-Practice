# üìò JavaScript Practice ‚Äì Day 5

This folder contains all the **practice problems** and one **mini project** I completed on **Day 5** of my JavaScript learning journey.

Today‚Äôs focus was on understanding and mastering **JavaScript Arrays**, including how to create, modify, iterate, and manipulate them using built-in methods.

## üõ†Ô∏è Mini Project: Simple Expense Tracker (Logic Only)

As part of today's practice, I built a small project called **_Simple Expense Tracker_**.

This project includes:
- Creating and managing an array of expense objects
- Adding new expenses dynamically
- Calculating total expense using `reduce()`
- Filtering expenses based on type or amount
- Using `map()` and `forEach()` for displaying expense details
- Practicing array mutation with `push()`, `splice()`, etc.

This project helped me apply all the array concepts in a real-world use case, without focusing on UI.
